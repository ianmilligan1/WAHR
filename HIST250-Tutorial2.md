## Writing and History

(1) What questions do historians ask when they sit down to write about something? 
	- the who, what, where, when, why like journalism
	- but the ‘what did other historians say’ of history
	- did others make mistake?
	- it all begins as an effort to answer questions about origins, happenings, and consequences

(2) How do we feel about the opening *American Historical Review* article?
	- It's an example of a tobacco
	- But it's also an example of the time.. for exmaple him saying "fe pwople would dream of condemning smoking as a moral scourage, or of banishign it from the streets and markets...." - well, we have, in Japan for example.

(3) What's up with his "Science" and "art" approach?
	- Solving such puzzles of history involves both science and art. Science is a synonym for knowledge.
	- "Patterned, coherent account of the human past intended to be true."
	- similar to the "Noble Dream" of Beard.

(4) What is the most important part of the historical process? What is it that historians do? (conversation around footnotes, ongoing conversation, the ‘cocktail party’ of history)

(5) What stories are historians interested in telling?

(6) What are the basic principles of writing good history? On each, do you agree?
	- Goal one: essays sharply focused on a limited topic - i.e. page 10 - think of introductions/conclusions, conclusions not introducing new ideas, etc. "If you try to do too much, you will not do anything."
		- THOUGHTS ON THIS?
		- has to be a fine line between "butter churn history" and "since the beginning of time, historians have X";
		- and no withholding of evidence - no trick endings, etc. (Alban story)
	- Goal two: historical essays should have a clearly stated argument
	- Goal three: Historical essays are built, step by step, on carefully acknowledged evidence
	- Goal Four: Historical essays reflect the dispassionate thoughts of the author (what do they think of this goal - when you should be happy with your paper - and what about strong opinions?)
	- Goal Five: Historical essays are clearly written with an intended audience in mind
		- I think this is bullshit - it really turns off audiences that don't share your area

(7) discussion around paraphrase/plagarism?

## Interpreting Primary Sources

Begin with a few documents:
- a book;
- a print out of a primary source;
- a journal article.

Ask them if each is a primary source/secondary source. Begin with primary, which is pretty simple. Then use a history book, try to trick them. They're probably too smart to be tricked.

(1) What is the chapter looking at? 

(2) What can you learn from a source? How far beyond a source do you think you can go? Are sources of varying utility?

(3) What questions do you need to ask when you’re reading a source? (the who, what, where, when, why)
probe in turn - what do we mean by those questions?!

(4) How do you know what to be sensitive about points of view in your sources?
- what are some examples given? (i.e. Carribean slaves, they might not add slaves to the record until they lived to a certain age, so infant mortality looks low even though its high)
- what are other examples from the course and your own work

(5) How should you take notes as you look at your primary document?
