supermarkets are bigger and food is cheaper than ever before. But are we \

homegrown food was an important part of our diet. Today, processed foods from \
factory farms dominate our kitchens. While fast foods are convenient and \
inexpensive, they come with a long-term cost. A healthy diet should be easy \
and affordable. The Green Party will: Provide more education on nutrition, \
healthy diets and lifestyles in schools and community centers. Enhance \
