This is just where I'm storing random code and commands for conducting basic text analysis on web archives in a variety of formats.

```
scrape-date-extraction.sh
```

When running scripts on large bodies of information stored in hadoop, we might get plain text that is storied in part files - and scrapes are spread out all over the place. These commands help you (well, me I guess) re-assemble text files per scrape.
