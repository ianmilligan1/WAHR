<h1>About this Project</h1>
<p>
This webpage provides discovery access to the University of Toronto's Archive-It Collection of Canadian Political Parties and Political Interest Groups, which they have been collecting since late 2005. For information on what is within this collection, please see <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/227">the University of Toronto's page</a>. It uses the <a href="https://github.com/ukwa/shine">UK Web Archive's shine interface</a>, which they made available here (needless to say, without their amazing work, this would not have been possible.)</p>
<p>The generated results need to be used with caution. As you can see from <a href="http://lintool.github.io/warcbase/vis/crawl-sites/">this visualization</a>, the composition of the collection changes dramatically over time: spikes and valleys may not be representative of actual historic shifts, but changes in the material. Similarly, the random search will be pulling results from tens, or even hundreds of thousands of results - many of which are automatically-generated pages within the web structure of these sites. Always dig into things, and question the results you are getting (which you should do with all databases, of course).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ukwa/shine">Shine</a> is very useful at running specific queries – finding embarassing things within political parties, for example (run a search for "Harper," the last name of our current Prime Minister, within 25 words of "fascist" and you'll find that the Green Party ran <em>*ahem*</em> provocative blog posts in 2008). You can also see how different organizations used different words: i.e. left-wing parties tended to use "depression" more than others, which used "recession" to describe the economic crisis. There is a literal treasure trove of stories to be found here.</p>
<p>However, it can be less useful in other cases: broad social and cultural trends seem straightforward, but as noted, there are problems with the underlying data. In many cases, we think that a more sophisticated textual analysis approach - isolating specific corpora, for example, extracting link diagrams to find central nodes and areas of interest, and beyond - may be more useful. The <a href="https://github.com/lintool/warcbase">warcbase platform</a> is a useful complement to this analysis.</p>
<p>We would love your comments and suggestions. Please contact <a href="http://ianmilligan.ca/">Ian Milligan</a> (Assistant Professor of History at the University of Waterloo).</p>
