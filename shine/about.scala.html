<h1>About this Project</h1>
<p>
Did you know that the Green Party of Canada ran a public blog on their website back in 2008, where anybody could write in? On our <a href="http://webarchives.ca/search/advanced">"advanced search" page</a>, you can search "harper" and "fascist" with a proxmity of "25" to see some provocative posts <a href="http://webarchives.ca/search/advanced?proximityPhrase1=harper&proximityPhrase2=fascist&proximity=25&action=search&order=asc">(results here)</a>. Alternatively, you can discover how terms like "depression" and "recession" waned and rose over time, through <a href="http://webarchives.ca/graph">our trends view</a>. We've tentatively found that left-wing groups tended to use the word "depression" more than centrist or right-wingers, who used "recession" more during the economic crisis? There is a literal treasure trove of stories to be found in these collections, limited only by your imagination.</p>
<p>On this site, we provide access to the University of Toronto's Archive-It Collection of Canadian Political Parties and Political Interest Groups, which they have been collecting since late 2005. For information on what is within this collection, please see <a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/227">the University of Toronto's page</a>. This site uses the <a href="https://github.com/ukwa/shine">UK Web Archive's shine interface</a>, which they made available here.</p>
<p>The generated results need to be used with caution. As you can see from <a href="http://lintool.github.io/warcbase/vis/crawl-sites/">this visualization</a>, the composition of the collection changes dramatically over time: spikes and valleys may not be representative of actual historic shifts, but changes in the material. Similarly, the random search will be pulling results from tens, or even hundreds of thousands of results - many of which are automatically-generated pages within the web structure of these sites. Always dig into things, and question the results you are getting (which you should do with all databases, of course).</p>
<p>We began with some provocative examples above, but we really do want to stress how you need to use these results with caution. The underlying data is messy. If you really want to get into this material - exploring link graphs, or playing with the plain text of a decade of a political party's website - alternative research approaches such as the <a href="https://github.com/lintool/warcbase">warcbase platform</a> might be more fruitful.</p>
<p>We would love your comments and suggestions. Please contact <a href="http://ianmilligan.ca/">Ian Milligan</a> (Assistant Professor of History at the University of Waterloo).</p>
